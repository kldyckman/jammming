# Jammming

Welcome, this was my solution to codeacademy's Feature Request: Jammming (React.js) project.

The app utilizes React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to allow users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

I opted to only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results. I hope that you find this helpful. Happy coding.
